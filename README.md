# Car-Price-Prediction
This project leverages various data science techniques and tools to help both buyers and sellers make informed decisions when dealing with pre-owned automobiles.
<h3>Objective:</h3>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the fair market value of a car based on a set of relevant features.
<h3>Components:</h3>
<ul><b>Data Collection:</b> The Data is collected from Kaggle.</ul>
<ul><b>Data Cleaning:</b> Handels the missing values and duplicates. Performed some data types conversion.</ul>
<ul><b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Visualized and analyzed the data to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (car price). This step helps in identifying patterns and outliers.</ul>
<ul><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Once the data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables.</ul>
<ul><b>Model Selection:</b> Several machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, Decision trees, Random forests, KNeighbours regression are considered for modeling.</ul> 
<ul><b>Model Training:</b> The selected model is trained using the preprocessed data. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.</ul>
<ul><b>Evaluation:</b> The model's performance is evaluated using R-squared (R2) to assess its accuracy in predicting car prices.</ul>
